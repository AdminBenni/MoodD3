Thanks for playing MOOD D3, legally distinct from DOOM 3D.

TEXT RENDERING:
    After submitting this I both tried the game on my desktop and had my
    friend try it on his computer and we both found that the text wasn't
    rendering properly. It i now 1:50 AM and I have yet to find out why
    this is happening, let alone fix it. I suspect it has something to do
    with the fact that both our desktops have NVIDIA GPU's but my laptop
    has an integrated AMD Radeon GPU. So here is a video demo of what the
    game looks like running on my laptop: https://youtu.be/Dxk1NcDG1AA
